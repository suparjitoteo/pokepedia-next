This project uses a handful of library as follows:
1. React Query (https://react-query.tanstack.com) to help us with fetching, caching and updating server state with ease.
2. Next.js (https://nextjs.org) allow us to build static and server-side rendering with ease. Also many benefits such as page-based routing, image optimization with zero config.
3. Chakra-UI for UI Component (https://chakra-ui.com)
4. Emotion (CSS-in-JS) (https://emotion.sh). Mainly because chakra-ui is using it. We can also overide style easily.
5. Color.js (https://github.com/luukdv/color.js) to get main color from the image.
6. React Icons (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) to provide us a lot of icons.
7. PouchDb (https://pouchdb.com) allow us to stored data in IndexedDB with nice APIs.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
